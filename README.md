# 🛒 Walmart Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This self-directed project is part of my Elevvo Internship, and it analyzes Walmart’s weekly sales data to uncover key trends, seasonality, and performance insights at the store and department levels.  
The dataset includes sales across multiple years, stores, and departments, with holiday indicators.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined sales distribution, seasonality, and patterns.  
- **Aggregations**:
  - Monthly and weekly sales trends
  - Top-performing stores and departments
  - Holiday vs. non-holiday comparisons
- **Time Series Smoothing**: Applied moving averages (3, 6, 12 months) to reveal long-term trends.
